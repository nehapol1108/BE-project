1,What is an operating system?,The operating system is a software program that facilitates computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. It is the most important part of a computer system without it computer is just like a box.,1,Operating Systems,Fundamentals,0
2,What is the difference between micro kernel and macro kernel?,Micro kernel: micro kernel is the kernel which runs minimal performance affecting services for operating system. In micro kernel operating system all other operations are performed by processor. Macro Kernel: Macro Kernel is a combination of micro and monolithic kernel.,2,Operating Systems,Kernels,0
3,What are the four necessary and sufficient conditions behind the deadlock?,1) Mutual Exclusion Condition: It specifies that the resources involved are non-sharable. 2) Hold and Wait Condition: It specifies that there must be a process that is holding a resource already allocated to it while waiting for additional resource that are currently being held by other processes. 3) No-Preemptive Condition: Resources cannot be taken away while they are being used by processes. 4) Circular Wait Condition: It is an explanation of the second condition. It specifies that the processes in the system form a circular list or a chain where each process in the chain is waiting for a resource held by next process in the chain.,3,Operating Systems,Deadlock,0
4,What are the different states of the process?,"Processes can be in one of three states: running, ready, or waiting. The running state means that the process has all the resources it needs for execution and it has been given permission by the operating system to use the processor. Only one process can be in the running state at any given time. The remaining processes are either in a waiting state (i.e., waiting for some external event to occur such as user input or disk access) or a ready state (i.e., waiting for permission to use the processor). In a real operating system, the waiting and ready states are implemented as queues that hold the processes in these states.",1,Operating Systems,Fundamntals,0
5,What is a deadlock?  ,"Deadlock is a situation when two or more processes wait for each other to finish and none of them ever finish.  Consider an example when two trains are coming toward each other on the same track and there is only one track, none of the trains can move once they are in front of each other.  A similar situation occurs in operating systems when there are two or more processes that hold some resources and wait for resources held by other(s). ",2,Operating Systems,Deadlock,0
6,Briefly explain FCFS?,"FCFS stands for First Come First Serve. In the FCFS scheduling algorithm, the job that arrived first in the ready queue is allocated to the CPU and then the job that came second and so on. FCFS is a non-preemptive scheduling algorithm as a process that holds the CPU until it either terminates or performs I/O. Thus, if a longer job has been assigned to the CPU then many shorter jobs after it will have to wait.",1,Operating Systems,Fundamentals,0
7,Explain RDBMS with examples.,RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.User to access and store data more efficiently than DBMS. RDBMS stores data in the form of tables as compared to DBMS which stores data as files. Storing data as rows and columns makes it easier to locate specific values in the database and makes it more efficient as compared to DBMS.,1,DBMS,Fundamentals,0
8,What is Banker’s algorithm?,"The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.",2,Operating Systems,Algorithms,0
9,Mention the different languages present in DBMS,DDL(Data Definition Language)Consists of commands which are used to define the database.DML(Data Manipulation Language) Consists of commands which are used to manipulate the data present in the database.DCL(Data Control Language)Consists of commands which deal with the user permissions and controls of the database system.TCL(Transaction Control Language)Consist of commands which deal with the transaction of the database.,2,DBMS,Fundamentals,0
10,What are overlays?,"The concept of overlays is that whenever a process is running it will not use the complete program at the same time, it will use only some part of it. Then overlays concept says that whatever part you required, you load it and once the part is done, then you just unload it, which means just pull it back and get the new part you required and run it. Formally, “The process of transferring a block of program code or other data into internal memory, replacing what is already stored”.",2,Operating Systems,Fundamentals,0
11,What is fragmentation?,"Processes are stored and remove from memory, which makes free memory space, which is too little to even consider utilizing by different processes.  Suppose, that process is not ready to dispense to memory blocks since its little size and memory hinder consistently stay unused is called fragmentation. This kind of issue occurs during a dynamic memory allotment framework when free blocks are small, so it can’t satisfy any request.",2,Operating Systems,Fundamentals,0
12,Do we consider NULL values the same as that of blank space or zero? ,"A NULL value is not at all same as that of zero or a blank space. The NULL value represents a value which is unavailable, unknown, assigned or not applicable whereas zero is a number and blank space is a character.",1,DBMS,Fundamentals,0
13,What is an entity-relationship model?,"It is a diagrammatic approach to database design, where you represent real-world objects as entities and mention relationships between them. This approach helps the team of DBAs’ to understand the schema easily.",1,DBMS,ER Model,0
14,What is the basic function of paging?,"Paging is a method or technique which is used for non-contiguous memory allocation. It is a fixed-size partitioning theme (scheme). In paging, both main memory and secondary memory are divided into equal fixed-size partitions. The partitions of the secondary memory area unit and the main memory area unit are known as pages and frames respectively. Paging is a memory management method accustomed fetch processes from the secondary memory into the main memory in the form of pages. in paging, each process is split into parts wherever the size of every part is the same as the page size. The size of the last half could also be but the page size. The pages of the process area unit hold on within the frames of main memory relying upon their accessibility",2,Operating Systems,Paging,0
15,What are the ACID properties in DBMS?,"ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability. It is used to ensure that the data transactions are processed reliably in a database system. Atomicity refers to those transactions which are completely successful or failed. Here each transaction refers to a single logical operation of a data. So, even if one part of any transaction fails, the entire transaction fails and the database state is left unchanged.Consistency ensures that the data must meet all the validation rules. In simple words,  you can say that your transaction never leaves the database without completing its state.The main goal of isolation is concurrency control.Durability means that if a transaction has been committed, it will occur whatever may be the scenario.",2,DBMS,ACID,0
16,What is the Direct Access Method?,"The direct Access method is based on a disk model of a file, such that it is viewed as a numbered sequence of blocks or records. It allows arbitrary blocks to be read or written. Direct access is advantageous when accessing large amounts of information. Direct memory access (DMA) is a method that allows an input/output (I/O) device to send or receive data directly to or from the main memory, bypassing the CPU to speed up memory operations. The process is managed by a chip known as a DMA controller (DMAC).",2,Operating Systems,Fundamentals,0
17,What is normalization and what are the different types of normalization?,First Normal Form (1NF) No repeating groups within rowsSecond Normal Form (2NF) Every non-key (supporting) column value is dependent on the whole primary key.Third Normal Form (3NF) – Dependent solely on the primary key and no other non-key (supporting) column value.,2,DBMS,Normalization,0
18,Write about monolithic kernel?,"Apart from microkernel, Monolithic Kernel is another classification of Kernel. Like microkernel, this one also manages system resources between application and hardware, but user services and kernel services are implemented under the same address space. It increases the size of the kernel, thus increases the size of an operating system as well. This kernel provides CPU scheduling, memory management, file management, and other operating system functions through system calls. As both services are implemented under the same address space, this makes operating system execution faster.",2,Operating Systems,Kernels,0
19,Explain the process behind storing a variable in memory.,"A variable is stored in memory based on the amount of memory that is needed. Following are the steps followed to store a variable:The required amount of memory is assigned first.Then, it is stored based on the data structure being used.Using concepts like dynamic allocation ensures high efficiency and that the storage units can be accessed based on requirements in real-time",2,Data Structure,Memory,0
20, What is a linked list data structure? ,"A linked list can be thought of as a series of linked nodes (or items) that are connected by links (or paths). Each link represents an entry into the linked list, and each entry points to the next node in the sequence. The order in which nodes are added to the list is determined by the order in which they are created.",1,Data Structure,Linked List,0

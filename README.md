# â€œA Semantic Approach for Automated Hiring using Artificial Intelligence & Computer Vision

The proposed system aims to completely automate the hiring process. This is mainly divided into four modules -

1. Resume classification - This module classifies a resume by comparing it with the job description using NLP.
2. Conducting the interview - This module is responsible for conducting the interview round by asking questions to the candidates and evaluating them.
3. Identifying soft skills -This module aims to identify the soft skills of the candidate by judging his facial expressions and voice modulation.  
4. Checking for malpractices - This module checks for any misconduct during the interview process.

This system generates a report at the end of the interview evaluating the interviewee and grading him/her.
